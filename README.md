# CarbonFootprintCalculator
A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide, that result from human activities such as transportation, energy use, and consumption of goods and services. It represents the impact each individual, organization, or activity has on global warming and climate change. A significant carbon footprint contributes to the greenhouse effect, leading to rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise. Reducing our carbon footprint is crucial for mitigating climate change, preserving ecosystems, and ensuring a sustainable future for upcoming generations. By adopting eco-friendly practices, we can collectively lower our impact and foster a healthier planet. In the following app, we have made a carbon footprint. Users can estimate their total carbon emissions by entering information about their gasoline and power consumption as well as their travel patterns. Next, the calculator offers customised recommendations on how they may lessen their impact, such switching to renewable energy sources, buying energy-efficient products, driving less, or eating a more environmentally friendly diet. These suggestions aid in the decision-making process for people and organisations so they can lessen their environmental effect and assist create a more sustainable future.
